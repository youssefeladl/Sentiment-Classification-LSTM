# Sentiment-Classification-LSTM
This project presents a deep learning-based approach to sentiment classification on a dataset of textual movie reviews. The goal is to train a binary classifier that predicts whether a given review is positive or negative.  We leverage a Bidirectional LSTM architecture with word embeddings to capture the sequential dependencies in the text data.
